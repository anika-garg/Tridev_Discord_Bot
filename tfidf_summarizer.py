# Louis Daniel Armstrong (August 4, 1901 â€“ July 6, 1971), nicknamed "Satchmo",[a] "Satch",
# and "Pops",[2] was an American trumpeter, composer, vocalist, and actor who was among the most influential
# figures in jazz. His career spanned five decades, from the 1920s to the 1960s, and different eras in the
# history of jazz.[3] In 2017, he was inducted into the Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame. Armstrong was born and raised in New Orleans.
# Coming to prominence in the 1920s as an inventive trumpet and cornet player, Armstrong was a foundational influence in jazz,
# shifting the focus of the music from collective improvisation to solo performance.[4] Around 1922, he followed his mentor,
# Joe "King" Oliver, to Chicago to play in the Creole Jazz Band. In Chicago, he spent time with other popular jazz musicians,
# reconnecting with his friend Bix Beiderbecke and spending time with Hoagy Carmichael and Lil Hardin. He earned a reputation
# at "cutting contests", and relocated to New York in order to join Fletcher Henderson's band. With his instantly recognizable rich,
# gravelly voice, Armstrong was also an influential singer and skillful improviser, bending the lyrics and melody of a song.
# He was also skilled at scat singing. Armstrong is renowned for his charismatic stage presence and voice as well as his trumpet
# playing. By the end of Armstrong's career in the 1960s, his influence had spread to popular music in general. Armstrong was one
# of the first popular African-American entertainers to "cross over" to wide popularity with white (and international) audiences.
# He rarely publicly politicized his race, to the dismay of fellow African Americans, but took a well-publicized stand for
# desegregation in the Little Rock crisis. He was able to access the upper echelons of American society at a time when this
# was difficult for black men.
